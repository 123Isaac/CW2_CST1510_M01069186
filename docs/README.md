# WARNING
As of making this on 29/11/2025, pyarrow (which is required to install streamlit) doesnt not have wheel for the latest version of python(python-1.13.4), so i have rolled back my python in a virtual environment to allow a smooth installition of streamlit.
This is what I've been struggle for weeks to fix. Yes I did ask my instructors for help.
