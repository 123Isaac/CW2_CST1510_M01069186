## Project Description
Implementation of AI
Organizing Code
Preparing for final submission

## INFO
The AI integration took about 5 hours and till the end I have made the code as authentic as possible. However as this GenAI model I am using requires billing due to certain uncontrollable factors i cannot add a proper billing address. However I have made EXTRA sure that this can work if the gen ai api is given tokens.

# WARNING-Old
As of making this on 29/11/2025, pyarrow (which is required to install streamlit) doesnt not have wheel for the latest version of python(python-1.13.4), so i have rolled back my python in a virtual environment to allow a smooth installition of streamlit.
This is what I've been struggle for weeks to fix. Yes I did ask my instructors for help.
